# Deni-Employee-Tracker-hw12

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). I was tasked to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation

The program runs with node.js. To run the program, navigate to the program's root folder in the command terminal and type: npm i

Connect to your MySQL server

Use the .envEXAMPLE folder as a template to create your own .env file with your password to your own MySQL database. The database in this application is named employee_db

How to run the program to begin prompts:

Navigate to the program's root folder in the command terminal and type: npm start or node index.js
